A Hansard is the official, verbatim record of parliamentary debates and proceedings. It documents everything said by members of parliament, including speeches, questions, and discussions, ensuring a transparent public record of legislative activity.

In Sri Lanka, the Hansard is especially important because it provides citizens, researchers, journalists, and policymakers with direct access to parliamentary debates since independence. It serves as a key historical and political resource, helping track how laws were shaped, how elected representatives engaged with national issues, and how parliamentary democracy has evolved over time.

A police press release is an official public statement issued by the police to inform citizens and the media about incidents, investigations, arrests, public safety alerts, or law enforcement initiatives. It serves as an authoritative source of information, countering rumors and ensuring transparency in policing.

In Sri Lanka, police press releases are especially relevant because they provide timely updates on security matters, traffic advisories, crime prevention campaigns, and major national events. Given the country’s sensitivity to issues of law, order, and public trust, these releases play a key role in shaping public awareness and confidence in the justice system.
