A Hansard is the official, verbatim record of parliamentary debates and proceedings. It documents everything said by members of parliament, including speeches, questions, and discussions, ensuring a transparent public record of legislative activity.

In Sri Lanka, the Hansard is especially important because it provides citizens, researchers, journalists, and policymakers with direct access to parliamentary debates since independence. It serves as a key historical and political resource, helping track how laws were shaped, how elected representatives engaged with national issues, and how parliamentary democracy has evolved over time.

In Sri Lanka, the Court of Appeal plays this role, shaping how laws are interpreted and setting important legal precedents that influence future cases. These judgments are central to upholding fairness, protecting rights, and strengthening the rule of law.
